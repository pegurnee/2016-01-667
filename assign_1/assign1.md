  A student record has four homework scores. Three students have the following records:
    s1 = (5 9 2 8)
    s2 = (6 8 3 5)
    s3 = (2 5 8 9)
  a. Find the euclidean distance based similarity between s1 and s2.
  b. Find the manhattan distance based similarity between s2 and s3.
  c. Decide which two students are most similar based on the euclidean distance between them.

  A store has 10 items, a customer purchase record shows which items were bought by a customer. Two customers have the following records:
    c1 = (0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1)
    c2 = (1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1)
  a. Compute the matching coefficient based similarity between c1 and c2.
  b. Compute the Jacard coefficient based similarity between c1 and c2.
  c. Suppose a store has 1000 items: c1 buys items 2 and 3, while c2 buys items 8 and 9. What are the matching coefficient and Jacard coefficient based similarities between c1 and c2. Which similarity gives the most correct result and why?
